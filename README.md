<h1> My Movie Recommendation Website </h1>

<h2> Objective </h2>
Build a content based movie recommendation system and make an API using django and deploy it on the cloud. </br> </br>

Recommendation system are everywhere. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form. Some of the best example are 'Youtube', 'Netflix', 'Spotify' etc. In this Project, I will create a Recommendation site and host it on Heroku. I took up this project as finding a good movie is one of the most classical problem that many of us face on a day to day basis(especially in this pandemic). Thus this recommendation system based on machine learning or deep learning to find movies that users are most likely to enjoy! </br>
